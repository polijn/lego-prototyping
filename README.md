# lego-prototyping
A collection of OpenSCAD files for prototyping with LEGO bricks.
The basis for LEGO prototyping is the LEGO.scad file from [cfinke](https://github.com/cfinke/LEGO.scad).

I got the idea during my thesis where one part was to design and build a microscope.
I came across a paper where they build an entire microscope out of LEGO bricks ([LEGO Paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.11.439311v1.full.pdf)).
This gave me the idea to use my old LEGO bricks to prototype the design of the microscope.
The conventional LEGO bricks' limitations led me to design my own specialized bricks in OpenSCAD.  
Fun fact: The first Google server was also built with LEGO bricks ([The Original GOOGLE Computer Storage](http://infolab.stanford.edu/pub/voy/museum/pictures/display/0-4-Google.htm)).


## the lego microscope prototype
This amazing visualization and animation was created using openSCAD and the mousepad ;).
The golden tubes with the green cones represent laser, the transparent circle can be a lens or in my case an emission filter, and the green square thing is a rasberry pi camera.

This is an image I took of the microscope prototype. The microscope is built out of LEGO bricks and the hardware is mounted by the specialized LEGO bricks.
