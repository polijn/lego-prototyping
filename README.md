# lego-prototyping
A collection of OpenSCAD files for prototyping with LEGO bricks.
The basis for lego prototyping is the LEGO.scad file from [cfinke](https://github.com/cfinke/LEGO.scad).

I got the idea during my thesis where one part was to design and build a microscope.
I came across a paper where they build an entire microscope out of LEGO bricks [LEGO Paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.11.439311v1.full.pdf).
This gave me the idea to use my old LEGO bricks to prototype the design of the microscope.
The limitation of the conventional LEGO bricks lead me to design my own specialized bricks in OpenSCAD.
Fun fact: The first Google server was build with LEGO bricks as well ([The Original GOOGLE Computer Storage](http://infolab.stanford.edu/pub/voy/museum/pictures/display/0-4-Google.htm)).
